# Air-Quality-Index-Prediction
The Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Project focuses on predicting AQI levels based on various environmental and pollutant parameters. The goal is to analyze air pollution data and develop a machine learning model that can estimate AQI, which is critical for monitoring public health and environmental safety.
